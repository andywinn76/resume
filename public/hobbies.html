    <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
    <p>I'm a dancing nerd. That about sums it up!</p>
    <h2>West Coast Swing Dancing</h2>
    <p>An avid West Coast Swing Dancer since March of 2016, shortly after my 40th birthday.</p>
    <p>As with many things in life, I got into swing dancing thanks to a girl. Taking my first lesson alongside her was the best decision I ever made.</p>
    <p>West Coast Swing is a slotted partner dance that focus on elastic connection and improvisation to music. It's not as fast or as bouncy as Lindy Hop or East Coast Swing.</p>
    <p>I used to compete in local and national events, and while I had a ton of fun and grew a lot as a dancer, competition highlighted things I didn't like about the dance and society in general: not feeling good enough, imposter syndrome, stress leading up to competition events, devastation when people don't do well, and a dancer's identity being caught up in the self as a competitor. I had a ton of fun doing it, but my time competing is probably done.</p>
    <h3>Notable Competition Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2017: 2nd Place, Novice Strictly at Swingtime Colorado</li>
        <li>2018: 2nd Place, Novice Jack and Jill at 528 Westival</li>
        <li>2019: 1st PLACE!!!, Novice Jack and Jull at Swingtime Colorado</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Board Gaming</h2>
    <p>I LOVE a good board game, and my sweet spot is deep strategy games that last between 60 and 90 minutes.</p>
    <p>My current Top 5 Games are (boardgamegeek.com links are included):</p>

    <h2>Video Gaming</h2>
    <p>I love relaxing with a good video game. Don't let anyone tell you that the incremental positive rewards from achieving goals isn't good for your mental health, because it is.</p>
    <h2>Miniature Painting</h2>
    <p>I don't paint Warhammer figures because I made a very wise financial decision NOT to.</p>
    <p>But I do paint minis for several of my boardgames, including Final Girl, Nemesis, Imperial Assault and many more. The artistic and meditative qualities of mini painting are very soothing.</p>
    <h2>3d Printing</h2>
    <p>I have three printers. One UV resin printer and two FDM filament printers. I print, as you might guess, accessories for my boardgames. I've designed several boardgame organizers to make setup and storage of games with many parts and pieces much easier. Boardgaming and 3d Printing are fantastic complementary hobbies.</p>
    <h2>Kayaking and Paddleboarding</h2>
    <p>Nothing is quite so calming as dipping my feet in a lake somewhere. Paddleboarding is my love right now because of the relaxed nature and incredible convenience.</p><p>Kayaking affords more adventure potential, including backcountry camping options, so it has a special place in my life.</p>
    <h2>Mountain Biking</h2>
    <p>The thrill of speeding along singletrack is second to none. Plus, it can burn 12 calories per minute on a tough climb.</p>
    <h2>Camping</h2>
    <p>Disconnecting and enjoying nature is the name of the game here, and I can combine this with most everything else listed above.</p>
